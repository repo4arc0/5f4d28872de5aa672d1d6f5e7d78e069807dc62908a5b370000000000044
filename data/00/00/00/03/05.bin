没看到宇宙灵球也没看到你
Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.

93
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,500
我之前就在那附近

很抱歉  可我不打算告诉你
I feel really bad about this, but I'm not gonna tell you that.

97
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,020
-我千辛万苦给你牵了线  -千辛万苦
- I slaved putting this deal together. - Slaved?

98
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,570
打几个电话就千辛万苦了  不是吧
Making a few calls is "slaved"? I mean, really?

99
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,740
你这是要坑我
And now you're gonna rip me off!

100
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,370
我们掠夺者不这么做事  我们有原则
We do not do that to each other. We're Ravagers. We got a code.

101
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,170
原则就是 "能抢就抢"
Yeah, and that code is "steal from everybody."

102
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,680
我从地星把你捡来的时候
When I picked you up on Terra...

103
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,180
"捡来"
"Picked me up."

104
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,560
我手下这些人可是想吃掉你的
these boys of mine wanted to eat you.

105
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,060
是吗
Yeah?

106
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,110
他们以前没吃过地星人肉
They ain't never tasted any Terran before.

107
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,670
我制止了他们  你活下来多亏了我
I stopped them. You're alive because of me!

108
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,030
我会找到你的  我要
I will find you, I will...

109
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,750
悬赏捉拿他

110
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,010
四万
Forty K.

111
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,700
-但我要捉活的  -是  船长
- But I want him back alive. - Yeah, Cap.

112
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,350
-捉活的  -你没听错
- Alive? - That's what I said.

113
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,830
你捡走他的时候我就跟你说了
I told you when you picked that kid up,

114
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,970
就该按照客户要求把他送过去
you should have delivered him like we was hired to do!

115
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,670
他不过是我们的货
He was cargo!

116
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,390
你对他一直太心软了
You have always been soft on him.

117
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,150
我看是对你太心软了
You're the only one I'm being soft on!

118
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,050
你别给我操心奎尔先生的事了
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

119
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,070
一旦把他抓回来
As soon as we get him back here,

120
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,930
我会亲手了结他
I'm gonna kill him myself.

121
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,050
我们需要操心的是
What we do need to worry about,

122
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,630
还有谁想得到那个灵球

罗南
Ronan,

145
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,840
克拉斯回来了
Korath has returned.

146
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,470
主人  那人就是个贼
Master, he is a thief,

147
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,700
一个自称星爵的法外之徒
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

148
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,590
但我们发现他跟一个叫
But we have discovered he has an agreement

149
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,310
"掮客"的中间人定下协议
to retrieve the Orb for an intermediary

150
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,570
拿回宇宙灵球
known as The Broker.

151
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,100
我跟灭霸保证过帮他拿回宇宙灵球
I promised Thanos I would retrieve the Orb for him.

152
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,280
那样他才帮我毁灭山达尔
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

153
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,730
星云  去山达尔帮我拿到宇宙灵球
Nebula, go to Xandar and get me the Orb.

154
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,920
这将是我的荣幸
It will be my honor.

155
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,690
这将是你的末路
It will be your doom.

156
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,000
要是你再次失败
If this happens again,

157
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,660
父亲可不会给你奖励
you'll be facing our father without his prize.

158
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,540
我是灭霸的女儿
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

159
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,030
和你一样
Just like you.

160
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,660
但我对山达尔更熟
But I know Xandar.

161
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,280
罗南已经命令我来...
Ronan has already decreed that I...

162
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,920
不要替我做决定
Do not speak for me.

163
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,560
你不可以失败
You will not fail.

164
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,810
我失败过吗
Have I ever?

172
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,470
都是一群废柴
What a bunch of losers.

173
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,990
所有人不是忙着做无聊事
All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid,

174
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,520
就是做无用功  真令人同情
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

175
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,480
看这个人
Look at this guy!

176
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,100
还管我们叫罪犯
Can you believe they call us criminals,

177
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,610
拿那个发型吓人才是犯罪
when he's assaulting us with that haircut?

178
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,560
这是什么东西  还自以为多炫酷
What is this thing? Look how it thinks it's so cool.

179
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,860
让人帮算什么酷
It's not cool to get help!

180
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,250
有本事自己走啊  小怪兽
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

181
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,680
你看那边的"微笑先生"
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.

182
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,340
你老婆在哪呢  老头子
Where's your wife, old man?

183
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,960
极品老变态
What a class-A prevert.

184
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,210
是吧  格鲁特
Right, Groot?

185
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,420
格鲁特
Groot?

186
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,020
别喝喷泉里的水  你个白痴
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

187
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,630
太恶心了
That's disgusting!

188
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,030
你喝了  我刚看到了
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

189
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,120
为啥要说谎
Why are you lying?

190
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,930
看来我们有目标了
Looks like we got one.

191
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,340
愚蠢的人类  看看你值多少钱
Okay, humie, how bad does someone wanna find you?

192
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:30,710
四万  格鲁特  我们要变有钱人了
40,000 units? Groot, we're gonna be rich.

193
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,600
-奎尔先生  -掮客
- Mr. Quill. - Broker.

194
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,700
宇宙灵球
The Orb.

195
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,300
-任务完成  -勇度呢
- As commissioned. - Where's Yondu?

196
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,190
他本来想亲自来的  但只能送上问候
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

197
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,300
同时让我转告
And told me to tell you,

198
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,910
你的眉毛是同行里最酷炫的
that you got the best eyebrows in the business.

199
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,180
这是什么意思
What is it?

200
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,970
我不可以透露客户和他们的要求
It's my policy never to discuss my clients, or their needs.

201
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,280
为了拿到它我可是九死一生
Yeah, well, I almost died getting it for you.

202
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,120
干你们这行就是有这样的风险
An occupational hazard, I'm sure, in your line of work.

203
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,690
一个机械脑袋怪物
Some machine-headed freak,

204
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,940
自称是什么罗南的手下
working for a dude named Ronan.

205
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,200
罗南  抱歉了  奎尔先生
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

206
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,360
真的很抱歉
I truly am.

207
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,180
但凡是跟罗南扯上关系的交易
But I want no part of this transaction

208
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,060
我是不会介入的
if Ronan is involved.

209
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,610
罗南是什么人
Who's Ronan?

210
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,890
一个克里的狂徒  被和平条约所激怒
A Kree fanatic, outraged by the peace treaty,

211
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,110
除非山达尔文明  我的文明被彻底清除
who will not rest until Xandarian culture, my culture,

212
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,730
否则他不会罢休的
is wiped from existence!

213
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,110
-拜托  -他这种人
- Come on. - He's someone

214
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,930
我招惹不起
whose bad side I'd rather not be on.

215
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,370
不是吧  那我就可以招惹吗
What? What about my bad side?

216
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,080
再会无期  奎尔先生
Farewell, Mr. Quill.

217
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,860
我们有约定在先的  老兄
Hey, we had a deal, Bro!

218
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,060
怎么了
What happened?

219
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,080
这家伙翻脸不认账
This guy just backed out of a deal on me.

220
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,230
我最讨厌的就是不守信用的男人
If there's one thing I hate, it's a man without integrity.

221
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,310
彼得·奎尔  大家都叫我星爵
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

222
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,810
看得出你是个正人君子
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

223
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,240
我也没那么好啦
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

224
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,930
大家倒都这么说我
People say it about me, all the time,

225
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,720
不过我一般不会这么夸自己
but it's not something I would ever say about myself.

226
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,460
这就不能怪我了
This wasn't the plan.

227
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,600
把他装进袋子  把他装进袋子
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag!

228
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,460
不  不是她  是他
No! Not her, him!

229
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,190
要分清性别啊
Learn genders, man.

230
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,450
不带咬人的
Biting? That's not fair!

231
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,540
放松
Take it easy!

232
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,280
蠢货  你该长点记性
Fool. You should have learned.

233
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,650
我从不长记性  缺点之一
I don't learn. One of my issues.

234
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,480
搞什...
What the...

235
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,500
别笑了  白痴  表现得专业点
Quit smiling, you idiot. You're supposed to be a professional.

236
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,410
饶了我吧
You gotta be kidding me.

237
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,070
我满足起来很容易
I live for the simple things.

238
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,550
比如想想这样会有多疼
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

239
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,650
没错  颤抖吧  凡人
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

240
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,350
还会再长出来的  你个二缺
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

241
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,750
别嘤嘤了
Quit whining.

242
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,570
实验体89P13  放下武器
Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.

243
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,150
该死
Aw, crap.

244
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,070
以新星军团的名义
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

245
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,790
-你们被逮捕了  -好了  站起来
- you are under arrest... - All right. Come on up.

246
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,240
罪名是危害他人生命及破坏财产
for endangerment to life and the destruction of property.

247
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,130
这不是星王子吗
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

248
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,720
-星爵  -抱歉了爵爷
- Star-Lord. - Sorry. "Lord."

249
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,940
我之前因为小偷小摸抓过他
I picked this guy up a while back for petty theft.

250
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,380
他还有个代号呢
He's got a code name.

251
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,650
请让开
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

252
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,900
拜托  一听就是个大盗的名字啊
Come on, man. It's a... It's an outlaw name.

253
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,310
没事的  小哥
Just relax, pal.

254
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,090
有代号挺酷的  也没有很奇怪了
It's cool to have a code name. It's not that weird.

255
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,380
法西斯
Fascists.

我认为这应该值得
I should think that would call

265
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,740
克里方面稍稍作出一些回应吧
for some slight response on the part of the Kree.

266
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,370
我们已经签订和平条约了  新星至尊
We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime.

你还想要什么
What more do you want?

至少克里帝国方面
At least a statement from the Kree Empire

269
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,240
应该谴责他的行为
saying that they condemn his actions.

270
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,880
他正在屠杀儿童
He is slaughtering children.

271
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,330
破坏家庭
Families.

272
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,620
这就是你们的事了
That is your business.

混蛋
Prick.

275
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,930
好消息
Well, some good news.

276
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,140
我们好像逮捕了罗南的同伙
It looks like we've apprehended one of Ronan's compatriots.

Surgically modified and trained as a living weapon.

279
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,680
"疯狂泰坦"灭霸的养女
The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan, Thanos.

280
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,020
最近灭霸派她和星云姐妹两人去辅佐罗南
Recently, Thanos lent her and her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

281
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,780
因此我们有理由相信
which leads us to believe

282
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,340
灭霸和罗南有勾结
that Thanos and Ronan are working together.

Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

284
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,290
在低等生命体上
The result of illegal genetic

285
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:05,440
进行非法基因改造和机械实验的产物
and cybernetic experiments on a lower life form.

286
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,340
什么鬼东西
What the hell?

287
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,300
他们叫它"格鲁特"
They call it "Groot."

288
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,730
近来作为89P13的私人植物及打手
A humanoid plant that's been travelling recently

289
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,780
陪伴其行动的类人植物

彼得·杰森·奎尔  来自地星
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

291
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,780
自幼被勇度·尤冬塔领导的佣兵组织"掠夺者"
Raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the Ravagers,

292
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,620
抚养成人
led by Yondu Udonta.

293
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,810
抱歉
I'm sorry.

294
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,840
我不知道这机器是怎么运作的
I didn't know how this machine worked.

295
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,090
真是一帮子混球
What a bunch of a-holes.

296
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,330
把四个都送到克林去
Transport all four to the Kyln.

{\an8}{\pos(40,42)}┌

303
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,540
我猜新星军团成员一般都遵纪守法
I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws,

304
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:44,490
可这里这些人腐败又残忍
but these ones here, they're corrupt and cruel.

305
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,830
反正我是不用担心
But, hey, that's not my problem.

306
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,500
我待不了多久的
I ain't gonna be here long.

307
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,930
我越过22次狱  这个也不例外
I've escaped 22 prisons. This one's no different.

308
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,340
这个妞出现是算你走运
You're lucky the broad showed up,

309
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,420
不然我和格鲁特
because otherwise, me and Groot

310
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,430
现在已经拿到赏金了
would be collecting that bounty right now,

311
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,940
至于你  已经被勇度和那些掠夺者
and you'd be getting drawn and quartered

312
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,710
五马分尸了
by Yondu and those Ravagers.

313
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,840
这些年想杀我的人可太多了
I've had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years.

314
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,290
怎么可能被一棵树和一只会说话的浣熊拿下
I ain't about to be brought down by a tree and a talking raccoon.

315
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,030
等等
Hold.

316
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,860
-浣熊是什么鬼  -浣熊是什么鬼
- What's a raccoon? - "What's a raccoon?"

317
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,560
你自己就是啊  傻货
It's what you are, stupid.

318
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,620
老子是这世上独一无二的
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

319
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,050
这个宇宙灵球是《死吻》中的神秘箱子
So, this Orb has a real shiny blue suitcase,

320
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,950
《夺宝奇兵》里的约柜
Ark of the Covenant,

321
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,520
还是《马耳他雄鹰》里的雕像啊
Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

322
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,230
-到底是什么  -我是格鲁特
- What is it? - I am Groot.

323
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,990
所以呢  那个宇宙灵球是什么
So what? What's the Orb?

324
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,490
我对阴险的小偷没什么好说的
I have no words for an honorless thief.

325
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,040
你还是个想灭绝别人的疯子的走狗呢
Pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey

326
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,890
真理直气壮
of a genocidal maniac.

327
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,900
对  我知道你是谁
Yeah, I know who you are.

328
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,920
大家都知道你是谁
Anyone who's anyone knows who you are.

329
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,670
对  我们知道你是谁
Yeah, we know who you are.

330
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,110
-她是谁  -我是格鲁特
- Who is she? - I am Groot.

331
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,900
你已经说过了
Yeah, you said that.

332
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,600
我不是来帮罗南拿回宇宙灵球的
I wasn't retrieving the Orb for Ronan.

333
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,110
我背叛了他
I was betraying him.

334
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,840
我已经私下跟第三方买家谈好了
I had an agreement to sell it to a third party.

335
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,970
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

336
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,510
你这句话说得
Well, that's just as fascinating

337
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,300
跟之前89次一样令人耳目一新
as the first 89 times you told me that.

338
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,590
这爱心树什么毛病
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

339
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,800
他没法像你我这样正常说话
Well, he don't know talking good like me and you.

340
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,160
所以他的词库里只有"我"
So his vocabulistics is limited to "I"

341
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,970
"是"和"格鲁特"三个词
and "am" and "Groot."

342
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,500
顺序乱了都不行
Exclusively in that order.

343
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,720
你知道吗  我的忍耐就要到极限了
I tell you what, that's gonna wear real thin, real fast.

344
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,690
给我放下
Put that away.

345
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,650
你个蓝皮怪  把那耳机摘下来
Listen to me, you big blue bastard. Take those headphones off.

346
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,100
那是我的  应该被扣押起来的
That's mine. Those belong to impound.

347
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,890
那磁带还有播放器  都是我的
That tape and that player is mine!

348
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,100
那是1973年蓝色瑞典人的
Hooked on a Feeling,

349
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,910
《迷上一种感觉》
Blue Swede, 1973.

350
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,750
那是属于我的歌
That song belongs to me!

351
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,700
-你死定了  你死定了  -凶手
- You first! You first! - Murderer!

352
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,990
老子先宰了你  卡魔拉  你死定了
Coming for you first, Gamora! You're dead!

353
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,440
你个垃圾  贱货
You're scum! You're scum!

354
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,950
我说过吧
It's like I said,

355
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,250
她名头响着呢
she's got a rep.

356
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,570
这里有好多囚犯的亲人
A lot of prisoners here have lost their families

357
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,370
都死在了罗南和他的狗腿子手下
to Ronan and his goons.

358
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,730
她最多撑一天
She'll last a day, tops.

359
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,040
杀人犯
Murderer!

360
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,660
警卫会保护她的吧
The guards will protect her, right?

361
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,560
他们只管阻止我们逃出去
They're here to stop us from getting out.

362
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,920
在里面怎么作死他们才不管
They don't care what we do to each other inside.

363
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,810
无论未来有什么大风大浪
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

364
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,050
跟我的经历比起来  也都是
are dreams compared to what's behind me.

365
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,090
瞧瞧这个新来的鲜肉
Check out the new meat.

366
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,160
我要把你浑身抹满古纳维恩液
I'm gonna slather you up in Gunavian jelly,

367
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,850
然后好好爽一发
and go to town...

368
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,370
先把话说清楚
Let's make something clear.

369
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,920
这小子的菊花是我们的
This one here is our booty!

370
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,490
你们想动他
You wanna get to him,

371
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,740
先过我们这一关
you go through us!

372
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,190
或者  说得更准确些
Or, more accurately,

373
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,980
我们先做了你
we go through you.

374
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,380
我是他们的
I'm with them.

375
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,880
我恨你们
I hate you.

376
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,220
再结实的牢房也别想保你的命
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

377
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,930
你死定了
You're dead!

378
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,890
死定了
Dead!

379
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,860
把她带到浴室去
Take her down to the showers.

380
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,430
那里血迹容易清理
It'll be easier to clean up the blood down there.

381
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,040
奎尔  你干什么去
Quill, where you going?

382
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,190
奎尔
Quill.

383
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,150
奎尔
Quill!

384
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,510
卡魔拉  我现在宣判你的死刑
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

385
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,470
为你对全银河系犯下的罪行偿命吧
for your crimes against the galaxy.

386
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,690
你敢
You dare?

387
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,670
你知道我是谁吧
You know who I am, yes?

388
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,010
你是德拉克斯
You're Drax.

389
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,800
毁灭者
The Destroyer.

390
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,150
奎尔
Quill!

391
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,010
你知道我这名号怎么来的吧
And you know why they call me this.

392
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,280
你宰过罗南手下数十个恶棍
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

393
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,630
罗南杀了我妻子  奥薇特
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

394
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,190
还有我女儿  卡玛莉亚
and my daughter, Camaria.

395
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,460
他将她们残杀致死
He slaughtered them where they stood.

396
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,590
但他却笑了
And he laughed!

397
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,630
奎尔
Quill?

398
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,940
她的命
Her life

399
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,580
轮不着你们来取
is not yours to take.

400
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,530
他杀了我家人
He killed my family.

401
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,210
我也要杀了他的家人
I shall kill one of his in return.

402
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,120
当然好  德拉克斯  给你  我
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

403
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,370
奎尔  你干什么
Quill! What are you doing?

404
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:21,480
我绝不是罗南或灭霸的家人
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

405
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,910
我是你阻止他的唯一希望
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

406
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,890
女人  你的话对我一文不值
Woman, your words mean nothing to me!

407
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,530
-别  别别别别  -见鬼
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! - Crap.

408
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,830
如果你的目标是杀了罗南
You know, if killing Ronan is truly your sole purpose,

409
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,930
杀了她也没法帮你实现目标
I don't think this is the best way to go about it.

410
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,050
这贱女人不是也刺杀过你吗
Are you not the man this wench attempted to kill?

411
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,300
反正她也不是第一个
Well, I mean, she's hardly the first woman

412
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,720
想杀我的女人了
to try and do that to me.

413
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,350
你看  这疤是一个巨火辣的拉贾克妞弄的
Look, this is from a smoking-hot Rajak girl.

414
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,430
拿叉子戳出来的
Stabbed me with a fork.

415
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,990
她不乐意我大清早就离她而去
Didn't like me skipping out on her at sunrise.

416
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,480
这条疤是因为有个克里妞想把我的胸腔破开
I got, right here, a Kree girl tried to rip out my thorax.

417
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,240
我在和新星档案处
She caught me with this

418
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,460
一个瘦瘦的阿斯卡瓦里安妞
skinny little A'askavariian

419
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,450
鬼混时被她抓包了
who worked in Nova Records.

420
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,430
我只是想套些消息而已
I was trying to get information.

421
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,140
你见过阿斯卡瓦里安人吧
You ever see an A'askavariian?

422
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,070
她们长着触角  牙齿跟针一样
They have tentacles, and needles for teeth.

423
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,520
你觉得我真会看上...
If you think I'm seriously interested in that, then...

424
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,330
好吧你不在乎  但我想说的是
You don't care. But here's the point.

425
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,920
她背叛了罗南  他会来追杀她
She betrayed Ronan. He's coming back for her.

426
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,580
等他自己找过来
And when he does,

427
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,580
到时你就可以
that's when you...

428
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,470
我为什么要把手指放在他的喉咙上
Why would I put my finger on his throat?

429
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,800
啥
What?

430
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,240
这只是个手势
No, it's a symbol.

431
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,330
这个手势表示你割了他的喉咙
This is a symbol for you slicing his throat.

432
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,960
我才不想割他的喉咙
I would not slice his throat.

433
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,480
我会一刀砍了他的脑袋
I would cut his head clean off.

434
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,000
这是通用手势啊  意思是杀人
It's a general expression for you killing somebody.

435
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,610
你听说过  见过这手势  对吧
You've heard of this. You've seen this, right?

436
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,160
-你知道这什么意思吧  -知道  知道
- You know what that is. - Yeah. Yeah.

437
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,490
-人人都知道  -不知道  不知道
- Everyone knows. - No, no.

438
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:53,210
我就是想说  你最好留她一命
What I'm saying is, you want to keep her alive.

439
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,270
别帮你敌人的忙
Don't do his work for him.

440
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,460
我喜欢你的刀  我收下了
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

441
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,660
-那是人家最喜欢的刀  -听着
- That was my favorite knife. - Listen!

442
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,900
我才懒得管你是死是活
I could care less whether you live or whether you die.

443
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,780
-那你拦下那大个子干什么  -简单
- Then why stop the big guy? - Simple.

444
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,580
你知道能把宇宙灵球卖给谁
You know where to sell my Orb.

445
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,980
我们和那东西都困在这里  你怎么卖
How are we gonna sell it when we and it are still here?

446
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,690
我这位火箭老兄
My friend Rocket, here,

447
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,140
成功越狱22次
has escaped 22 prisons.

448
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,030
我们肯定出得去
We're getting out.

449
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,980
然后我们直奔勇度那里去取你的赏金
And then we're headed straight to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

450
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,780
你那买家打算花多少钱买我的宇宙灵球
How much was your buyer willing to pay you for my Orb?

451
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,300
四十亿
Four billion units.

452
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,020
-多少  -我操
- What? - Holy shit.

453
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,980
宇宙灵球是我逃离灭霸和罗南的机会
That Orb is my opportunity to get away from Thanos and Ronan.

454
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,130
如果你能越狱
If you free us,

455
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,390
我就直接带你去见买家
I'll lead you to the buyer directly

456
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,140
卖的钱我们三个平分
and I'll split the profit between the three of us.

457
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,980
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

458
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,460
四人平分
Four of us.

459
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,670
出事儿了睡大觉  一听见钱就来精神
Asleep for the danger, awake for the money,

460
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,170
死性不改
as per frickin' usual.

461
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,140
你被背叛了  罗南
You have been betrayed, Ronan.

462
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,620
我们只知道她被捉住了
We know only that she has been captured.

463
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,470
卡魔拉也许还有机会取回宇宙灵球
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

464
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,060
错  我们在克林的线人
No! Our sources within the Kyln

465
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,380
说卡魔拉对宇宙灵球自有打算
say Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.

466
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,590
你跟灭霸的合作
Your partnership with Thanos

467
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,500
已经岌岌可危了
is at risk.

468
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,980
灭霸要见你  现在就见
Thanos requires your presence. Now!

469
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,900
恕我直言  灭霸
With all due respect, Thanos,

470
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,340
{\an8}{\pos(263,47)}┌

471
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,340
{\an8}┐

472
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,340
{\an8}{\pos(263,60)}└

473
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,340
{\an8}┘

474
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:33,590
{\an8}{\pos(276,51)}圣域

475
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,590
{\an8}{\pos(283,41)}灭霸领地

476
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,670
是你女儿惹下的麻烦
your daughter made this mess,

477
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,270
你却传唤我过来
and yet you summon me.

478
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,510
你最好说话小声些  指控者
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

479
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,430
她先是败在一群原始人手下
First, she lost a battle with some primitive.

480
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,260
灭霸把卡魔拉交由你调遣
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

481
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,150
然后还被新星军团送进大牢
Then she was apprehended by the Nova Corps.

482
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,190
现在空口无凭的人是你
You are the one here with nothing to show for it.

483
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,350
是你的线人说她早已谋划背叛我们
Your sources say that she meant to betray us the whole time!

484
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,660
放尊重点
Lower your tone!

485
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,860
我虽是你的
I may be your...

486
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,950
我只希望您把这当回事
I only ask that you take this matter seriously.

487
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,780
小子  我不当回事的
The only matter I do not take seriously, boy,

488
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,460
只有你了
is you.

489
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,700
你的政治权术真无聊
Your politics bore me.

490
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,990
你做事像个闹脾气的孩子
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

491
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,500
而且很显然
And, apparently,

492
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,970
是你逼走了我最爱的女儿  卡魔拉
you alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora.

493
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,350
我会践行我们的约定的  克里人
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

494
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,180
但你务必将宇宙灵球带给我
if you bring me the Orb.

495
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,580
如果下次见我时你再两手空空
But return to me again empty-handed,

496
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,510
我就用你的血染红整个星系
and I will bathe the starways in your blood.

497
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,300
多谢了  父亲  很公平
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

498
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,350
这场争斗你赢不了
This is one fight you won't win.

499
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,260
我们去克林吧
Let's head to the Kyln.

500
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,020
如果我们想逃出去
If we're gonna get out of here,

501
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,860
得设法进到那边的瞭望塔里
we're gonna need to get into that watchtower.

502
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,700
为此我需要几件东西
And to do that, I'm gonna need a few things.

503
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,300
警卫都佩戴着安保臂带
The guards wear security bands

504
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,820
来控制人员进出  我要一个
to control their ins and outs. I need one.

505
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,660
交给我
Leave it to me.

506
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,670
那边那位  我需要他的假腿
That dude, there. I need his prosthetic leg.

507
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,430
-他的腿  -对
- His leg? - Yeah.

508
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,820
其他的部分我可不需要
God knows I don't need the rest of him.

509
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:16,660
瞧瞧他  废物
Look at him, he's useless.

510
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,140
好吧
All right.

511
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,530
最后一样  后边的墙上
And finally, on the wall back there

512
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,540
有块黑色面板  闪着黄灯的
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

513
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,750
-瞧见了没  -看见了
- Do you see it? - Yeah.

514
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,930
里面有块柯尼斯电池
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.

515
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,950
紫颜色的  接着绿色电线
Purplish box, green wires.

516
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,190
要想进瞭望塔  我需要这东西
To get into that watchtower, I definitely need it.

517
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,710
要怎么才能拿到
How are we supposed to do that?

518
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,070
这群秃头佬应该觉得你挺美
Well, supposably, these bald-bodies find you attractive.

519
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,790
所以你可以色诱一个
So, maybe you can work out some sort of trade.

520
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,350
你逗乐呢吧
You must be joking.

521
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,910
没有  我真听他们说你挺美
No, I really heard they find you attractive.

522
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,630
你看  那东西离地20英尺
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

523
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,560
而且还处在
and it's in the middle of

524
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,150
一座戒备森严的监狱正中央
the most heavily-guarded part of the prison.

525
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,990
想要不被发现  绝不可能
It's impossible to get up there without being seen.

526
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,110
我想了个计划
I got one plan,

527
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,310
而这计划他妈的还就需要柯尼斯电池
and that plan requires a frickin' quarnyx battery,

528
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,470
所以你给我想办法去
so figure it out!

529
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,830
我接着说了哈  多谢
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

530
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,830
接下来这点非常重要
Now, this is important.

531
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,470
一旦电池被取下来
Once the battery is removed,

532
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,990
监狱就会进入警戒状态
everything is gonna slam into emergency mode.

533
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,790
所以一旦得手  就必须迅速行动
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,

534
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,710
因此务必在最后一步再取下电池
so you definitely need to get that last.

535
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,590
或者先拿电池  再随机应变
Or we could just get it first and improvise.

536
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,700
-我去取臂带  -我去拿腿
- I'll get the armband. - Leg.

537
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,780
囚犯
Prisoner,

538
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,740
立即放下该设备  退回监房
drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell,

539
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,870
否则我们就开火了
or we will open fire.

540
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,900
我  是
I am

541
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,790
格鲁特
Groot!

542
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,300
开火
Fire!

543
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,310
所有囚犯立即返回休息区
All prisoners return to your sleeping areas.

544
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,310
你个白痴
You idiot!

545
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,100
家伙不在手上  我怎么跟这些东西打
How am I supposed to fight these things without my stuff?

546
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,820
是那动物在指挥
The animal is in control.

547
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,020
听我命令准备开火
Fire on my command!

548
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,820
猥琐的小怪物
Creepy little beast!

549
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,460
这才像话
Yeah.

550
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,220
你想要我的啥
You need my what?

551
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,900
-把这个给我  -请便吧
- I'll need this. - Good luck.

552
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,470
这是内置在体内的
It's internally wired.

553
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,310
我自有办法
I'll figure something out.

554
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,430
把腿放下
Drop the leg!

555
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,060
把腿放下  回到自己监房去
Drop the leg and move back to your cell!

556
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,310
火箭
Rocket!

557
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,500
朝瞭望塔前进
Move to the watchtower!

558
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,500
你
You!

559
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,460
睡过阿斯卡瓦里安人的男人
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

560
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,620
就那么一次而已
It was one time, man.

561
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,990
所有待命警卫请全副武装
We need all available guards in full combat gear...

562
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,830
不要怨恨地盯着我  女人
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

563
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,980
这家伙来干什么
Why is this one here?

564
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,420
我们答应了
We promised him he could

565
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,020
让他跟着我们  直到手刃了你老大
stay by your side until he kills your boss.

566
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,470
我向来信守承诺
I always keep my promises,

567
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,190
尤其是面对一个肌肉呆男
when they're to muscle-bound whack-jobs

568
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,860
我不同意就宰了我的时候  给你
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

569
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,950
腿我是开玩笑的
I was just kidding about the leg.

570
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,150
我只需要这两样东西
I just need these two things.

571
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,950
-什么  -我就觉着会挺好笑啊
- What? - No, I thought it'd be funny.

572
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,060
多好笑啊
Was it funny?

573
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,950
等等  他单腿跳是个什么样子
Wait, what did he look like hopping around?

574
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,990
我可是花了三万块买的他的腿
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

575
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,100
我们要怎么逃脱
How are we going to leave?

576
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,540
他想好计划了
Well, he's got a plan.

577
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,430
有的吧  难道也是编出来逗人玩的
Right? Or is that another thing you made up?

578
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,980
有计划的  我有计划的
I have a plan! I have a plan!

579
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,750
别再唧唧歪歪的了
Cease your yammering

580
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,470
赶紧带我们冲出这恼人的监牢吧
and relieve us from this irksome confinement.

581
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,980
这回我跟这个活字典
Yeah, I'll have to agree with the walking thesaurus

582
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,950
看法相同
on that one.

583
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,460
不准再叫我字典
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

584
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,340
就是个比喻而已  哥们
It's just a metaphor, dude.

585
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,860
他们只能理解字面意思
His people are completely literal.

586
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,390
弄个比喻就绕晕了
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

587
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,070
我怎么绕都不晕的
Nothing goes over my head.

588
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,300
我的反应特别快  肯定能走出去
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

589
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,820
我要全银河最蠢的人死在一起了
I'm gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

590
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,350
那些枪威力可不小
Those are some big guns.

591
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,820
听我号令
On my command!

592
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,740
第一发
Number one!

593
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,700
耗子  你的计划呢
Rodent, we are ready for your plan.

594
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,620
急什么
Hold on!

595
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,460
第二发
Number two!

596
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,190
我认得这种动物
I recognize this animal.

597
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,510
我们小时候会拿来架在火上烤
We'd roast them over a flame pit as children.

598
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,820
肉质相当鲜美
Their flesh was quite delicious.

599
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,100
帮倒忙呢你
Not helping!

600
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,260
第三发
Number three!

601
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,150
全体听我号令
All fire on my command!

602
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,660
三
Three!

603
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,340
二
Two!

604
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,940
一
One!

605
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,100
他把人工重力关掉了
He turned off the artificial gravity,

606
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,220
除了这座瞭望塔里的
everywhere but in here.

607
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,820
我就说我有计划
I told you I had a plan.

608
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,780
这计划真是太完美了
That was a pretty good plan.

609
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,380
太好了  在那边  去开我的飞船
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

610
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,470
米拉诺号  那边角落里橙蓝相间的那艘
It's the Milano, the orange and blue one over in the corner.

611
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,260
居然把我的裤子卷成一团
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.

612
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,420
真没礼貌  你们的都是叠好了的
That's rude! They folded yours.

613
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,620
宇宙灵球在里面呢  快走
The Orb's there. Let's go.

614
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,430
-等下  等下等下  -怎么了
- Wait, wait, wait. - What?

615
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,180
那混蛋没放回来
That bastard didn't put it back.

616
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,180
-什么没放回来  -拿着
- Put what back? - Here.

617
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,110
带到船上去  我随后就到
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

618
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,250
你打算怎么
How are you gonna possibly...

619
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,790
让米拉诺号停在附近就行
Just keep the Milano close by.

620
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,100
走吧
Go.

621
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,540
快走啊
Go!

622
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,660
我的脖子
My neck!

623
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,860
他打算怎么跟我们会合
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

624
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,110
他拒绝向我透露相关信息
He declined to share that information with me.

625
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,670
那就去他的
Well, screw this, then!

626
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,110
我才不想傻等一个作死的人类
I ain't waiting around for some humie with a death wish.

627
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,420
宇宙灵球在你手上呢  是吧
You got the Orb, right?

628
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,190
对
Yes.

629
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,590
如果现在再不走  我们会被轰成渣的
If we don't leave now, we will be blown to bits.

630
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,670
不行
No!

631
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,020
宇宙灵球没到手决不能走
We're not leaving without the Orb.

632
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,670
快看
Behold.

633
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,260
你果然有胆识
This one shows spirit.

634
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,220
在和罗南对战时肯定是个得力帮手
He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan.

635
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,870
朋友  你回去拿什么了
Companion, what were you retrieving?

636
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,620
真是个蠢材
You're an imbecile.

637
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,980
{\an8}{\pos(192,38)}浣熊形象的卡通人物

638
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,980
游侠瑞克  你这是在干嘛
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

639
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,340
你怎么没经过同意就拆我的飞船
You can't take apart my ship without asking me!

640
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,390
-这是什么  -别碰那个
- See, what is this? - Don't touch that!

641
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,470
是个炸弹
It's a bomb.

642
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
-炸弹?  -对
- A bomb? - Yup.

643
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,300
你就把炸弹那样放着
And you leave it lying around?

644
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,030
我本来打算找个盒子放进去的
I was gonna put it in a box.

645
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,220
放到盒子里有用吗
What's a box gonna do?

646
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,540
-这个怎么样  -不行
- How about this one? - No! Hey!

647
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,950
-别碰  -为什么  这是什么
- Leave it alone. - Why? What is it?

648
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:55,270
闭嘴
Shut up.

649
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,620
那个是什么
What is that?

650
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,510
这是在万分危急时候用的
That's for if things get really hardcore.

651
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,580
或者想炸卫星时候用的
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

652
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,970
我不会让你们炸卫星
No one's blowing up moons.

653
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:06,020
乐趣都被你抹杀光了
You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.

654
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,300
我需要你联系的买家坐标
So, listen, I'm gonna need your buyer's coordinates.

655
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,670
暂时来说  我们的航行方向没有问题
We're heading in the right direction. For now.

656
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,750
如果你真想合作的话
If we're gonna work together,

657
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,180
至少试着多信任我点
you might try trusting me a little bit.

658
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,780
那你有多信任我
And how much do you trust me?

659
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,360
如果你告诉我这是什么
I'd trust you a lot more

660
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,950
我就能更信任你
if you told me what this was.

661
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,780
我猜这是某种武器
Because I'm guessing it's some kind of weapon.

662
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,270
我也不知道这是什么
I don't know what it is.

663
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,620
如果真是武器  那就能用来对付罗南了
If it's a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.

664
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,700
快放下  你个傻子  你会害死我们的
Put it down, you fool. You'll destroy us all.

665
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,820
只想害死你  女杀手
Or just you, murderess!

666
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,580
我可救了你一次  小娘子
I let you live once, princess!

667
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,780
我才不是娘子
I am not a princess!

668
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,500
在我的飞船上别闹出人命
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

669
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,740
我们得团结一致拿到钱
We're stuck together until we get the money.

670
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:44,020
我可不是为了钱
I have no interest in money.

671
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,460
棒极了
Great.

672
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,870
那我们三个又能多分点了
That means more money for the three of us.

673
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,220
我们四个
For the four of us.

674
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,750
伙伴们
Partners.

675
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,430
我们是有约在先
We have an agreement,

676
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,500
但我绝不会做你这种人的伙伴
but I would never be partners with the likes of you.

677
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,580
我去通知买家我们在路上了
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

678
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,940
奎尔  你的船真恶心
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

679
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,100
这才哪到哪
She has no idea.

680
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,750
用黑光灯一照
If I had a black light,

681
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,260
整艘飞船里都是我的涂鸦
the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.

682
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,260
{\an8}{\pos(192,38)}美国抽象表现主义画家  以"滴洒"作画闻名

683
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,620
你该吃药了  奎尔
You got issues, Quill.

684
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,940
我发誓  我真的不知道他们去哪了
I swear. I don't know where they went! I swear.

685
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,230
如果他知道的话
If he knew where they were headed,

686
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,470
早就告诉我们了
he would have already told us.

687
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,060
罗南
Ronan,

688
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,350
新星军团派了一支舰队过来守卫监狱
the Nova Corps sent a fleet to defend the prison.

689
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,380
那好吧
Well, then,

690
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,740
派死灵舰去找遍宇宙的每个角落
send Necrocraft to every corner of the quadrant.

691
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,220
给我找到灵球
Find the Orb.

692
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,300
不惜一切代价
Any means, any price.

693
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,870
这里怎么处置
And this place?

694
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,500
不能让新星知道我们在找什么

00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,380
好吧
Fine.

834
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,300
我可不保证这事完了后
But I can't promise, when all this is over

835
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,030
我不会把你们这群混蛋全杀了
I'm not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.

836
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,700
看到没  这就是为什么你们都没朋友
See? That's exactly why none of you have any friends!

837
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,720
跟别的人才认识五秒
Five seconds after you meet somebody,

838
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,030
你就想着要杀了他们了
you're already trying to kill them!

839
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:00,030
我们穿过了半个星系来到这
We have travelled, halfway across the quadrant.

840
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,180
连罗南的毫毛都没伤着
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

841
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,580
-德拉克斯  -让他去
- Drax! - Let him go.

842
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:07,980
我们不需要他
We don't need him.

843
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,380
卡魔拉女士
Milady Gamora.

844
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,380
我过来接你去见我主人
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

845
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,620
这里一点也不诡异
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

846
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:25,900
我们的馆藏珍品在整个星系是最多的
We house the galaxy's largest collection

847
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,060
动物  遗骸  不同物种应有尽有
of fauna, relics, and species of all manner.

848
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,300
容我为你们介绍
I present to you,

849
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:41,100
坦利亚·蒂万  收藏者
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

850
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,020
亲爱的卡魔拉
My dear Gamora.

851
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,220
能见到本尊真是荣幸
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

852
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,940
省掉这些繁文缛节吧  蒂万
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

853
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,900
我们有你要的东西
We have what we discussed.

854
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:11,420
那边那个是什么东西
What is that thing there?

855
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,300
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

856
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,030
我从来没想到能遇见个格鲁特
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

857
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,620
先生
Sir...

858
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,090
请务必把您的尸体卖给我
You must allow me to pay you now

859
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,580
我现在就付款
so that I may own your carcass.

860
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,630
当然了  要等您死后
At the moment of your death, of course.

861
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,020
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

862
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,940
怎么  给你拿去做个椅子吗
Why, so he could turn you into a frickin' chair?

863
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:33,520
这是你的宠物吗
That's your pet?

864
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,030
-他的什么  -蒂万
- His what? - Tivan.

865
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:40,380
我们穿越大半个银河系  取来了灵球
We have been halfway around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

866
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,620
非常好  那么
Very well, then.

867
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,260
让我看看你们带来的东西
Let us see what you brought.

868
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,670
三块柯尼斯电池  七箱科他蒂种子
Three quarnyx batteries, seven cases of Cotati seeds.

869
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:05,230
不  要七箱  上次你寄过来的
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

870
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,740
你得帮我传达个信息
You shall send a message for me.

871
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,200
我的新朋友们
My new friends.

872
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,060
在宇宙开创之前
Before creation itself,

873
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,940
一共有六个奇点
there were six singularities.

874
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,900
然后宇宙大爆炸创造了万物
Then the universe exploded into existence,

875
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,100
这六个奇点的残留物
and the remnants of these systems

876
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:29,700
被收集起来凝炼成宝石
were forged into concentrated ingots.

877
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,740
称作无限宝石
Infinity Stones.

878
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,390
这些宝石似乎
These stones, it seems,

879
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,380
只有拥有非凡的力量
can only be brandished

880
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:41,020
才能驾驭
by beings of extraordinary strength.

881
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,220
请看
Observe.

882
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:51,310
这些携带者借助宝石能摧毁整个文明
These carriers can use the Stone to mow down entire civilizations

883
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:54,860
跟收麦子一样易如反掌
like wheat in a field.

884
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,620
我已经快吓尿了
There's a little pee coming out of me right now.

885
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,660
曾经有那么一次
Once, for a moment,

886
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:04,870
一个组织成功地共同控制了这股能量
a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves,

887
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,990
但即使是他们也很快被这力量摧毁了
but even they were quickly destroyed by it.

888
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,860
太美了
Beautiful.

889
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,190
无与伦比
Beyond compare.

890
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,770
我们都沉醉其中了  白毛
We're all very fascinated, whitey.

891
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:26,280
但是快给钱
But we'd like to get paid.

892
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,260
你们希望用什么方式付款
How would you like to get paid?

893
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:32,010
你说呢  花花公子  当然是现金
What do you think, fancy man? Units!

894
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,020
很好
Very well, then.

895
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,980
卡瑞娜
Carina.

896
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,300
别靠近
Stand back.

897
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,620
我再也不要做你的奴隶了
I will no longer be your slave!

898
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,220
不
No!

899
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,620
我了个
What the...

900
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,360
我怎么会相信蒂万
How could I think Tivan

901
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,860
知道如何控制宇宙灵球里的东西
could contain whatever was within the Orb?

902
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,110
你还拿着是要做什么
What do you still have it for?

903
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,510
不然怎么办  留在那儿吗
What are we gonna do, leave it in there?

904
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:54,080
你竟然还装进自己的荷包里了
I can't believe you had that in your purse!

905
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:55,920
这是个背包  不是荷包
It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

906
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,670
我们必须把这个交给新星军团
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps.

907
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:59,500
他们可能知道如何控制它
There's a chance they can contain it.

908
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,780
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

909
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,300
我们正在被新星军团通缉
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.

910
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,300
把它交给罗南就是了
Just give it to Ronan!

911
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,010
然后帮他毁了整个银河系吗
So he can destroy the galaxy?

912
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:06,820
怎么了你  突然变成圣人了吗
What are you, some saint all of a sudden?

913
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,520
银河系帮过你吗
What has the galaxy ever done for you?

914
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,950
你为什么想救它
Why would you wanna save it?

915
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:11,710
因为我就生活在这里面啊
Because I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!

916
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,230
彼得  听我说
Peter, listen to me.

917
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:16,460
绝不能让宝石落入罗南之手
We cannot allow the Stone to fall into Ronan's hands.

918
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,220
我们现在就回你飞船
We have to go back to your ship,

919
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:19,870
然后送去新星
and deliver it to Nova.

920
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,420
好的  就这样  你说得对
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

921
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,690
或者我们可以把它交给某个
Or we could give it to somebody

922
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,140
不会逮捕我们的
who's not going to arrest us,

923
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,540
大好人
who's really nice

924
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,380
然后大赚一笔
for a whole lot of money.

925
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:31,470
我觉得这是个
I think it's a really good

926
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:33,060
能两全其美的好方法
balance between both of your points of view.

927
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,220
你太卑鄙
You're despicable.

928
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:35,900
太无耻
Dishonorable.

929
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:37,540
毫无信用
Faithless!

930
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,830
-不  -终于
- No. - At last!

931
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,860
我要面对我的仇敌并且亲手解决他了
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

932
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,740
是你叫来了罗南
You called Ronan?

933
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:54,620
奎尔  别想跑  小子
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

934
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,900
你敢跑  别挡道
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

935
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,310
指控者罗南
Ronan the Accuser!

936
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:07,070
是你传送的信息吗
You are the one who transmitted the message?

937
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:08,270
你杀了我妻子
You killed my wife.

938
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:11,020
你杀了我女儿
You killed my daughter!

939
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,260
我都说了  你进不来的
I told you, you can't fit.

940
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,300
在这儿等我回来
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

941
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:31,260
是卡魔拉  她带着宇宙灵球逃走了
It is Gamora. She is escaping with the Orb.

942
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,710
不
No!

943
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:42,820
星云
Nebula,

944
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:45,310
去夺回宇宙灵球
retrieve the Orb.

945
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,740
宝石在最前面那个作业舱里
The Stone is in the furthest pod.

946
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,700
击落它
Bring it down!

947
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:37,420
火箭  掩护卡魔拉到米拉诺号
Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano.

948
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,980
怎么掩护  这上面又没有武器
How? We've got no weaponry on these things.

949
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,000
这些作业舱都是工业级的
These pods are industrial grade.

950
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,620
基本上坚不可摧
They're nearly indestructible.

951
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,890
那也吃不消死灵炮啊
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

952
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,660
我可不是那个意思
That's not what I'm saying.

953
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:37,820
借你飞船用一用
Let me borrow your ride.

954
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,420
我不记得杀过你家人
I don't recall killing your family.

955
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:19,100
大概也不会记得杀过你
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

956
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:38,580
奎尔  我被困住了  到不了米拉诺号
Quill, I'm trapped. I can't make it to the Milano.

957
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:40,460
只能冲去外层空间了
I have to head out.

958
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,660
等等  这些作业舱不能飞到外层空间去
Wait! These things aren't meant to go out there.

959
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,620
你太让我失望了  姐姐
You are a disappointment, sister.

960
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:56,300
在所有姐妹当中
Of all our siblings,

961
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:58,660
我最不讨厌的就是你
I hated you least.

962
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:00,340
星云  别这样
Nebula, please.

963
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:02,140
如果罗南得到了宝石
If Ronan gets this stone

964
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:04,300
-他会杀光我们所有人  -不是所有人
- He'll kill us all. - Not all.

965
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:07,700
你活不到那时候
You will already be dead.

966
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:05,260
罗南  东西到手了
Ronan, it is done.

967
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,300
奎尔  算了
Quill, come on.

968
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,340
她的身体改造过  大概能撑几分钟
Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes,

969
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,500
可我们没办法救她
but there's nothing we can do for her.

970
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:16,220
这些作业舱在外面坚持不了多久的
These pods aren't meant to be out here.

971
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,740
很快  我们也会像她一样
In a second, we're gonna be in the same boat.

972
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:28,580
去他的
Aw, damn it.

973
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,340
奎尔
Quill?

974
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,260
勇度  勇度
Yondu! Yondu.

975
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,710
我是奎尔
This is Quill!

976
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:38,300
-我现在的坐标是227K324  -奎尔
- My coordinates are 227K324. - Quill.

977
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:39,700
奎尔  你在干什么
Quill, what are you doing?

978
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,310
就在无存知地外面
Just outside Knowhere.

979
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,580
如果你在的话  就来抓我吧
If you're there, come get me.

980
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,790
我随你处置
I'm all yours.

981
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,220
奎尔  别犯傻
Quill, don't be ridiculous.

982
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:00,940
回你的作业舱里去
Get back into your pod!

983
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,380
里面装不下两个人  你会死的
You can't fit two people in there. You're gonna die.

984
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:07,460
你马上就会死的
You'll die in seconds!

985
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:08,940
奎尔
Quill.

986
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,670
奎尔
Quill?

987
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,830
怎么了
What happened?

988
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,020
我看见你漂浮在外面
I saw you out there.

989
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:21,900
我也不知道自己怎么了
I don't know what came over me.

990
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,700
我不能眼睁睁让你死
But I couldn't let you die.

991
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:29,940
我突然感受到了内心深处的一种
I found something inside of myself.

992
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,550
一种
Something

993
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,480
难以置信的英雄气概
incredibly heroic.

994
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,940
我不是在夸自己
I mean, not to brag,

995
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:40,420
可是  客观地说
but, objectively...

996
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,540
宇宙灵球呢
Where's the Orb?

997
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:45,620
他们把宇宙灵球抢走了
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

998
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:46,820
什么
What?

999
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:52,020
欢迎回家  彼得
Welcome home, Peter.

1000
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,660
蠢货  全是无可救药的蠢货
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

1001
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,260
奎尔竟然自投罗网了
Quill just got himself captured.

1002
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,060
要不是你
None of this ever would have

1003
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:25,700
一意孤行  非要去单挑罗南
happened if you didn't try to single-handedly

1004
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:27,100
这一切都不会发生
take on a frickin' army!

1005
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,100
你说得没错
You're right.

1006
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,900
我是个傻瓜
I was a fool.

1007
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,060
所有的愤怒
All the anger,

1008
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,540
所有的怨气
all the rage,

1009
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:47,020
都是为了掩饰我的伤痛
was just to cover my loss.

1010
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:57,940
"我的老婆孩子都死了"
Boo-hoo-hoo. "My wife and child are dead."

1011
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,700
我才不在乎这有多残忍
I don't care if it's mean!

1012
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,740
谁家没死过人
Everybody's got dead people.

1013
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,070
不代表你就有理由让大家
It's no excuse to get everybody else

1014
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:08,140
陪你一起送死
dead along the way!

1015
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:14,620
好了  格鲁特  罗南拿到了宝石
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

1016
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:15,900
我们现在唯一能做的
The only chance we got

1017
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:18,110
就是赶紧飞往宇宙另一头去
is to get to the other side of the universe

1018
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:20,020
越快越好
as fast as we can and maybe,

1019
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:22,800
也许趁着那神经病还没打过来
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives

1020
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,820
能安稳的过一辈子
before that whack-job ever gets there.

1021
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:28,660
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1022
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:31,100
救他们  怎么救
Save them? How?

1023
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:34,020
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1024
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:36,920
我知道他们是我们唯一的朋友
I know they're the only friends that we ever had,

1025
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,670
可他们现在落在掠夺者军队手里
but there's an army of Ravagers around them.

1026
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,470
我们只有两个人
And there's only two of us!

1027
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,740
是三个
Three.

1028
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:55,060
我都被你们气得
You're making me

1029
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:56,790
只能  拿草
beat...up

1030
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:57,980
撒气了
grass!

1031
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,220
宇宙灵球已经在我手里了
The Orb is in my possession,

1032
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:04,860
我说到做到
as I promised.

1033
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:06,540
把它送到我这里来
Bring it to me.

1034
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:10,020
没错  这是我们之前约定好的
Yes, that was our agreement.

1035
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,430
我帮你拿来宇宙灵球
Bring you the Orb,

1036
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:16,140
你帮我毁灭山达尔
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

1037
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:20,860
不过  既然我知道了它装有无限宝石
However, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone,

1038
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:23,020
我很好奇我还要你做什么
I wonder what use I have for you.

1039
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,700
小子
Boy,

1040
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:27,610
你最好给我想清楚了
I would reconsider your current course.

1041
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,860
主人  你不能这么做
Master! You cannot!

1042
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,540
灭霸是这宇宙中最强大的存在
Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.

1043
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:35,830
不再是了
Not anymore.

1044
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:00,900
你竟然叫我"小子"
You call me "Boy!"

1045
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:02,300
我会代表克里
I will unfurl

1046
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:05,620
对千年来山达尔的所作所为进行审判
1,000 years of Kree justice on Xandar,

1047
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:09,300
让它消失殆尽
and burn it to its core!

1048
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:11,420
之后  灭霸
Then, Thanos,

1049
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,540
我就去找你算账
I am coming for you.

1050
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,820
毁灭山达尔之后  你会杀掉我父亲吗
After Xandar, you are going to kill my father?

1051
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:21,140
你想反抗我吗
You dare to oppose me?

1052
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,190
你也看到他对我做了些什么
You see what he has turned me into.

1053
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:27,460
你杀了他  我会再帮你毁灭一千个星球
If you kill him, I will help you destroy a thousand planets.

1054
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,780
你敢背叛我?
You betray me?

1055
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:31,700
偷我的钱?
Steal my money?

1056
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:33,420
住手  放开他
Stop it! Leave him alone!

1057
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:35,900
你小时候刚被我捡到的时候
When I picked you up as a kid,

1058
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,380
这些小子想吃了你
these boys wanted to eat you.

1059
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,980
他们还没尝过地星人的味道呢
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

1060
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:42,910
是我救了你
I saved your life!

1061
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:45,090
还有完没完啊  天哪
Will you shut up about that? God!

1062
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,630
二十年了  一直给我说这些陈芝麻烂谷子
Twenty years, you been throwing that in my face,

1063
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:50,430
好像没有吃掉我是件多么伟大的事
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

1064
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:54,020
正常人哪会每天想着吃人啊
Normal people don't even think about eating someone else!

1065
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,660
不吃我难道我还得谢你吗
Much less that person having to be grateful for it!

1066
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:58,460
是你劫持了我
You abducted me, man.

1067
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:01,220
把我从家里掳走  害我无亲无故
You stole me from my home and from my family.

1068
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,500
你他妈才不是因为在乎你们地星
You don't give a damn about your Terra!

1069
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,020
你害怕
You're scared

1070
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,350
不过是因为内心太懦弱了
because you're soft in here.

1071
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:08,460
这里  就在这里
Here, right here!

1072
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:09,820
勇度
Yondu!

1073
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,270
听我说
Listen to me.

1074
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,540
罗南掌握着一块叫无限宝石的东西
Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.

1075
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:15,460
我知道他手里有什么  小姑娘
I know what he's got, girl.

1076
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:17,940
那你就该知道  我们必须把它抢回来
Then you know we must get it back!

1077
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:21,500
他会用宝石摧毁掉山达尔
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

1078
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:23,050
我们得警告他们
We have to warn them.

1079
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:24,750
否则无数的人会因此丧命
Billions of people will perish.

1080
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,470
她就是这样给你洗脑的吗  小子
Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy?

1081
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,620
多愁善感
Sentiment?

1082
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,990
蛆虫一样蚕食掉你的大脑
Eating away your brain like maggots!

1083
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,990
就这样吧
That's it.

1084
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:39,700
不
No!

1085
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,260
抱歉了  小子
Sorry, boy.

1086
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:43,210
身为队长  必须杀一儆百
But a captain's gotta teach his men

1087
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,940
让手下知道背叛会是什么下场
what happens to those what cross him.

1088
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,700
队长要以身作则
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

1089
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,420
如果你现在杀了我
If you kill me now,

1090
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:55,710
就别想做成这辈子最大一笔生意了
you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen.

1091
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:02,270
无限宝石吗
The Stone?

1092
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:04,980
你最好能想出个别的
I hope you got something better than that.

1093
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:07,790
没有人能从罗南手里偷东西
Because ain't nobody stealing from Ronan.

1094
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,270
我们有秘密武器
We got a ringer.

1095
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:11,870
是吗
Is that right?

1096
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,380
她清楚有关罗南的一切
She knows everything there is to know about Ronan.

1097
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,780
他的舰队
His ships,

1098
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:18,510
他的部下
his army.

1099
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,500
他也有弱点
He's vulnerable.

1100
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,670
你觉得怎么样  勇度
Hey, what do you say, Yondu?

1101
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:26,260
我和你  还跟以前一样  携手作战
Me and you, taking down a mark side-by-side, like the old days.

1102
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,060
放开他
Let him go!

1103
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:39,300
你小子一向有种
You always did have a scrote, boy!

1104
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:42,230
所以我当时才留你在身边
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

1105
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,460
队长  这种攻击不痛不痒的
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

1106
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,820
请注意  蠢货们
Attention, idiots.

1107
01:14:56,900 --> 01:15:00,700
飞船上这个疯子手里拿着的是强子枪
The lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer.

1108
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:02,580
我独家设计的武器
It's a weapon of my own design.

1109
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:03,860
这是在搞什么
What the hell?

1110
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:07,020
要是你们不赶紧交出我朋友
If you don't hand over our companions now,

1111
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:09,500
他就把你们的飞船轰出个新鲜的洞
he's gonna tear your ship a new one.

1112
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:11,420
又大又新鲜的洞
A very big new one!

1113
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:14,420
-老子才不买你的账  -我倒数五下
- I ain't buyin' it. - I'm giving you to the count of five.

1114
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:18,100
-5  4  3  -别  等一下
- 5, 4, 3... - No! Wait, hold on!

1115
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:20,020
火箭  是我  真是的
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

1116
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:22,180
已经谈拢了  我们没事了
We figured it out! We're fine!

1117
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:23,900
奎尔  怎么回事
Hey, Quill. What's going on?

1118
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,150
这就叫"谈拢了"
You call that "Figured it out"?

1119
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,330
要从那群把我们
We're gonna rob the guys

1120
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:29,740
打得屁滚尿流的家伙手里抢东西
who just beat us senseless.

1121
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,150
你还有脸说屁滚尿流
You want to talk about senseless?

1122
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:33,550
你到底是想救我们还是想把我们炸飞
How about trying to save us by blowing us up?

1123
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:35,250
他们要是不交出你们
We were only gonna blow you up

1124
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:36,470
我才会把他们炸飞
if they didn't turn you over!

1125
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,300
你只数五下
And how on earth were they gonna turn us over

1126
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:40,020
他们哪有时间交出我们
when you only gave them a count of five?

1127
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:42,460
我们又没空考虑倒数时间
We didn't have time to work out the minutiae

1128
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,670
那些细节
of the plan.

1129
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:46,070
我们为朋友两肋插刀就这下场
This is what we get for acting altruistically.

1130
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:48,180
-我是格鲁特  -他们根本不领情
- I am Groot. - They are ungrateful.

1131
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:49,460
重点是
What's important now

1132
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,270
我们说服了掠夺者军队
is we get the Ravagers' army

1133
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:52,670
帮我们拯救山达尔
to help us save Xandar.

1134
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,230
然后我们再把宝石交给勇度
So we can give the Stone to Yondu

1135
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:56,280
好让他卖给一个更邪恶的家伙吗
who's just gonna sell to somebody even worse?

1136
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,700
这个之后再议
We'll figure that part out later.

1137
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:59,510
我们必须阻止罗南
We have to stop Ronan.

1138
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:00,980
怎么阻止
How?

1139
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,270
我有个计划
I have a plan.

1140
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,300
你有个计划?
You've got a plan?

1141
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:04,820
没错
Yes.

1142
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,420
首先  那句话是我说的
First of all, you're copying me from

1143
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:07,950
-你算是抄袭  -哪有
- when I said I had a plan. - No, I'm not.

1144
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:09,360
这话谁都会说
People say that all the time.

1145
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,070
又没什么特别的
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

1146
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,940
其次  我不相信你有什么计划
Secondly, I don't even believe you have a plan.

1147
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,830
我有一部分计划
I have part of a plan!

1148
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:17,500
一部分是多少
What percentage of a plan do you have?

1149
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,070
鉴于你在无存知地的表现
You don't get to ask questions

1150
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:20,820
你没有权利提问
after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.

1151
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,630
我可救了奎尔
I just saved Quill.

1152
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:23,710
我们已经讨论过了
We've already established

1153
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,580
你们想炸了我乘坐的飞船  那可不是在救我
that you destroying the ship that I'm on is not saving me.

1154
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:26,630
我们什么时候讨论过了
When did we establish it?

1155
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:27,660
就几秒钟以前
Like three seconds ago!

1156
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:29,900
我没在仔细听  那会儿正走神
I wasn't listening. I was thinking of something else.

1157
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,020
她说得没错  你没有发表意见的权利
She's right. You don't get an opinion.

1158
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:33,500
你有百分之多少的计划
What percentage?

1159
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:35,070
我不知道  百分之十二吧
I don't know. Twelve percent.

1160
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,510
百分之十二?
Twelve percent?

1161
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:39,580
你笑得真假
That's a fake laugh.

1162
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:41,550
-是真的  -太假了
- It's real! - Totally fake.

1163
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:43,840
这是我这辈子笑得最真实
That is the most real, authentic,

1164
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:46,180
最歇斯底里的一次了
hysterical laugh of my entire life

1165
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:47,690
因为你这是狗屁计划
because that is not a plan.

1166
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:48,950
只能算是一个想法
It's barely a concept.

1167
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,100
你站到他们那一边去了吗
You're taking their side?

1168
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:51,460
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1169
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:53,030
是比百分之十一要强点  又怎样
So what, it's better than 11%?

1170
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:54,630
你那狗屁计划能有什么用
What the hell does that have to do with anything?

1171
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:56,860
谢谢你  格鲁特  谢谢
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

1172
01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:00,820
格鲁特是你们当中唯一一个明事理的
See? Groot's the only one of you who has a clue.

1173
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:06,860
伙伴们
Guys.

1174
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:08,780
拜托
Come on.

1175
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:11,030
勇度马上就要过来了
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

1176
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:13,540
他还想听听我们的大计划呢
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

1177
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,860
我需要你们的帮助
I need your help.

1178
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:20,900
看看我们
I look around at us.

1179
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:22,420
知道我看到了什么吗
You know what I see?

1180
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:24,820
一群失败者
Losers.

1181
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,630
我们就像
I mean, like,

1182
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:30,790
一群失魂落魄的家伙
folks who have lost stuff.

1183
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:32,980
确实如此  我们所有人都失去过
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

1184
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,430
失去了家
Our homes,

1185
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:37,550
失去了家人
our families,

1186
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:40,580
失去了正常的生活
normal lives.

1187
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,480
没错  生活本来就是付出比回报更多
And, usually, life takes more than it gives.

1188
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,710
可今天不是
But not today.

1189
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,820
今天我们得到了眷顾
Today, it's given us something.

1190
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,550
生活给了我们一个机会
It has given us a chance.

1191
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,060
什么机会
To do what?

1192
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:52,260
去拼一回
To give a shit.

1193
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,820
仅此一回
For once.

1194
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:57,020
不要逃避
Not run away.

1195
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:02,390
罗南要屠杀无数无辜的生命
I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch

1196
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,500
而我  绝不会袖手旁观
as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives.

1197
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:09,220
可是  奎尔  想要阻止罗南
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

1198
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:12,340
是不可能的
it's impossible.

1199
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:15,140
你是在叫我们去送死
You're asking us to die.

1200
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:23,700
是啊  应该是吧
Yeah, I guess I am.

1201
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:37,660
奎尔
Quill.

1202
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:45,180
我活了这么久  只跟敌人打过交道
I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies.

1203
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:53,430
我愿意和朋友共生死
I will be grateful to die among my friends.

1204
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:59,880
你是个有担当的男人  奎尔
You are an honorable man, Quill.

1205
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:03,580
我愿意跟你并肩作战
I will fight beside you.

1206
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:06,300
最后
And in the end,

1207
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:10,300
我就能和我的妻女团聚了
I will see my wife and daughter again.

1208
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:19,420
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1209
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:32,980
随你们吧  反正本来我也活不长
What the hell. I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway.

1210
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:41,220
我也站起来了  你们满意了吧
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1211
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,860
现在我们都站起来了
We're all standing up now.

1212
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:47,350
一群傻缺  站成个圈圈
Bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle.

1213
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,060
宝石会对任何有机体产生反应
The Stone reacts to anything organic.

1214
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:58,310
目标越大  威力越强
The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.

1215
01:19:58,340 --> 01:19:59,390
罗南只需要让宝石
All Ronan's got to do is

1216
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:01,500
接触到星球的表面  它就会毁掉一切
touch the Stone to the planet's surface and zap.

1217
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,310
所有的植物  动物
All plants, animals,

1218
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:05,220
-新星军团  -一切都将被毁灭
- Nova Corps. - Everything will die.

1219
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:07,540
所以不能让罗南登陆
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1220
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,460
火箭带领一队人马在暗黑星号右舷
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole

1221
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:14,780
轰开一个洞
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

1222
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:19,070
这样我们和勇度的飞船就可以攻进去了
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1223
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:21,950
里面有上百个萨卡士兵把守吧
Won't there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1224
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:24,820
萨卡士兵都是纸做的
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1225
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,140
他们一旦得知我们登陆了
Once they know we're on board,

1226
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:33,520
罗南会关上舱内的安全门
Ronan will isolate himself

1227
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,670
把自己隔离起来
behind impenetrable security doors on deck.

1228
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:38,140
我可以通过破坏动力系统解锁
Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.

1229
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,070
接着我们进到驾驶舱
We'll make it to the flight deck,

1230
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:43,520
用强子枪把罗南轰上天
and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.

1231
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:48,740
罗南一死我们就回收宝石
Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the Stone.

1232
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,780
记得要把它装进这些装置里
Use these devices to contain it.

1233
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:53,490
别直接触摸
If you touch it,

1234
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:55,120
不然小命就没了
it will kill you.

1235
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:01,120
我会联络之前逮捕过我们的新星警官
I'll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us.

1236
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:03,280
但愿他们相信我们是来帮忙的
Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help.

1237
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:04,170
{\an8}正在呼入

1238
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:04,170
{\an8}彼得·奎尔

1239
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:07,740
完成计划还需要最后一步
There's one more thing we need to complete the plan.

1240
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:09,700
那家伙的眼睛
That guy's eye.

1241
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:12,090
不  瞎说什么呢
No! No, we don't.

1242
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:14,630
我们不需要那家伙的眼睛
No, we don't need that guy's eye.

1243
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:18,340
不  说真的  对我来说相当重要呢
No, seriously, I need it! It's important to me.

1244
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,750
已发现罗南舰队
Ronan's fleet has been spotted,

1245
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:27,780
预计十五分钟后抵达
and will arrive in T-minus fifteen minutes.

1246
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:29,550
听好了  小子
Remember, boy.

1247
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:31,860
这事完了之后
At the end of all this,

1248
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:33,450
宝石归我
I get the Stone.

1249
01:21:33,530 --> 01:21:36,280
敢耍我就砍死你们
You cross me, we kill you all.

1250
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:59,870
准备大干一场吧  小子们
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1251
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:10,440
这计划烂死了
This is a terrible plan.

1252
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:13,220
不是你说要和朋友共生死的吗
Hey, you're the one who said you wanted to die among friends.

1253
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,490
新星至尊
Nova Prime.

1254
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:23,120
一个掠夺者刚刚给我传达了一则消息
I received a transmission from one of the Ravagers.

1255
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:26,380
他说罗南得到了一颗什么无限宝石
He says Ronan's in possession of something called an Infinity Stone

1256
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:27,870
正冲着山达尔来
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1257
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:28,750
老天爷
Good God.

1258
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:31,180
不过是个幌子  别忘了他是罪犯
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1259
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:33,670
他有说我们为什么要相信他吗
Did he say why we should believe him?

1260
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,060
他说他们一帮人刚刚越狱
He said his crew just escaped from prison,

1261
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:39,230
如果不是为了拯救山达尔没理由冒险
so he'd have no other reason to risk coming to Xandar to help.

1262
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,640
他说他确实是个
He says that he's an...

1263
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:43,480
"混球"
"A-hole."

1264
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:44,860
但不是一个
But he's not...

1265
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,780
引用他原话就是
and I'm quoting him, here,

1266
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:49,100
"彻头彻尾的混蛋"
"100% a dick."

1267
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,770
你信他吗
Do you believe him?

1268
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:54,150
我也不知道有没有彻头彻尾的混蛋  夫人
I don't know that I believe anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1269
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:57,300
我是问  你相信他是来帮忙的吗
I mean, do you believe that he is here to help?

1270
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:02,020
信啊
Yeah.

1271
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,590
不明舰队逼近中
A fleet approaches.

1272
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,620
看起来像是掠夺者
They appear to be Ravagers.

1273
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:27,900
开火
Fire!

1274
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,300
掩护就位
Cover it down.

1275
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:42,380
全体下潜
Submerge!

1276
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:56,880
火箭  快上
Rocket, hurry!

1277
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:04,270
全体飞行员下潜
All pilots, dive!

1278
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,580
他们在我们正下方
They're beneath us!

1279
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:15,830
疏散全体市民
Evacuate the city.

1280
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:19,460
我们的首要任务是确保人民安全撤离
Our priority is to get our people away from the battle.

1281
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,290
全速推进  动作快
Forward thrust, now!

1282
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:42,020
加把劲儿
Come on!

1283
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:45,340
奎尔  勇度  趁现在
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1284
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:09,150
妈的
Aw, hell!

1285
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:10,780
我被击落了  奎尔
I'm going down, Quill!

1286
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,660
别给我耍花招  小子
No more games with me, boy!

1287
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:15,420
完事之后我们再会
I'll see you at the end of this!

1288
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,800
他们人太多了  火箭
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1289
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,940
我们没法突围
We'll never make it up there!

1290
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:42,100
彼得·奎尔
Peter Quill.

1291
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:44,660
我是新星军团的丹纳利安·萨尔
This is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps.

1292
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:48,100
先声明一下  我始终认为不该相信你
For the record, I advised against trusting you here.

1293
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:49,620
看来我的"混蛋"消息他们收到了
They got my "Dick" Message!

1294
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:51,220
用事实证明我错了吧
Prove me wrong.

1295
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:00,580
爽
Yes!

1296
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:23,150
够嗨
Yes!

1297
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:28,060
我们和凯文·贝肯差不多厉害吧
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1298
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:33,910
右舷核心部位受创
The starboard kern has been breached!

1299
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,240
他们闯进来了
We have been boarded.

1300
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:36,670
继续向前推进
Continue our approach.

1301
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:38,100
但是新星军团也掺合进来了
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1302
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:40,910
着陆之后一切就都不是问题了
None of that will matter once we reach the surface.

1303
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:42,020
关闭所有安全门
Seal security doors!

1304
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:43,350
赶紧
Now!

1305
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:46,510
别挡老娘的路
Get out of my way!

1306
01:26:58,230 --> 01:27:00,110
老天
Oh, man.

1307
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:01,860
所有新星飞行员听令
All Nova pilots,

1308
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:04,700
全体对接形成封锁网
interlock and form a blockade.

1309
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:08,620
务必阻止暗黑星号着陆
The Dark Aster must not reach the ground.

1310
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:22,340
已锁入
Locked in!

1311
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:24,340
已锁入
Locked in.

1312
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:26,900
已锁入
We're locked in.

1313
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:07,380
我什么都看不见
I can barely see.

1314
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:35,460
你什么时候学了这一招
When did you learn to do that?

1315
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:37,100
我猜答案肯定是
Pretty sure the answer is

1316
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:38,860
"我是格鲁特"
"I am Groot."

1317
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:42,540
飞行甲板就在前方300米处
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

1318
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,420
我希望你们知道
I want you all to know that

1319
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:48,190
感谢你们  不在意我的鲁莽之举
I am grateful for your acceptance

1320
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:49,230
依然接受我
after my blunders.

1321
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,900
再次有朋友相伴的感觉...
It is pleasing to once again have...

1322
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:53,540
真棒
friends.

1323
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:57,550
奎尔  你是我朋友
You, Quill, are my friend.

1324
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:58,780
谢了
Thanks.

1325
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:01,710
这颗蠢树也是我朋友
This dumb tree, he is my friend.

1326
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:04,420
还有这个绿婊子也
And this green whore, she, too...

1327
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:06,060
给我闭嘴
You must stop!

1328
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:11,700
卡魔拉  看看你干的好事
Gamora, look at what you have done.

1329
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:14,380
你还是一如既往的软弱
You have always been weak.

1330
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:16,780
愚蠢  背信弃...
You stupid, traitorous...

1331
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:24,260
不要这么跟我朋友说话
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1332
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:26,500
你们去飞行甲板
Head to the flight deck.

1333
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:29,310
我去切断安全门的动力
I'll shut down the power to the security doors.

1334
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,100
勇度·尤冬塔
Yondu Udonta.

1335
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:43,310
命令自己的手下向新星军团投降
Order your men to turn on the Nova Corps.

1336
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:01,060
玩够了没  掠夺者
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1337
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:03,020
你的死期到...
Time to die...

1338
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:37,370
星云  别这样
Nebula, please.

1339
01:30:51,340 --> 01:30:53,960
够了  死灵舰队飞行员
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

1340
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:56,510
开始自我献祭吧
enact immolation initiative.

1341
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:01,350
他们冲下去轰炸城市了
They're dive-bombing the city!

1342
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:03,180
丹纳利安·萨尔  需要解除连锁吗
Denarian Saal, should we break formation?

1343
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:04,990
不行  保持阵形
No! Hold your positions.

1344
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:38,010
拖住罗南  萨尔
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1345
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,870
下面市民的安全交给我们了
We'll take care of the people down here.

1346
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:42,100
我居然要听命于一只小仓鼠
I can't believe I'm taking orders from a hamster.

1347
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:46,850
星爵
Star-Lord.

1348
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:48,190
终于记住了
Finally.

1349
01:31:58,940 --> 01:31:59,980
你个卑鄙的贼
You thief!

1350
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,700
你们休想攻到罗南那儿去
You will never make it to Ronan.

1351
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:22,700
在死灵舰着陆之前就把他们轰下来
Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground.

1352
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:32,700
来吧
Come on!

1353
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:19,020
手指划过喉咙就是杀人
Finger to the throat means death.

1354
01:33:24,860 --> 01:33:26,270
我用比喻了
Metaphor.

1355
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:27,700
差不多吧
Yeah, sorta.

1356
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,020
不是吧
Oh, no.

1357
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:58,430
山达尔
Xandar!

1358
01:33:58,710 --> 01:34:01,750
接受制裁吧
You stand accused.

1359
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:06,870
可悲的和平条约也救不了你们了
Your wretched peace treaty will not save you now.

1360
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:11,080
跟条约一起葬身火海吧
It is the tinder on which you burn.

1361
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:36,260
火箭
Rocket!

1362
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:38,220
坚持住  萨尔  再坚...
Hold on, Saal, just...

1363
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,180
奎尔  你得快点了
Quill, you gotta hurry.

1364
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:08,030
市民倒是都被疏散了
The city's been evacuated,

1365
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:10,390
可我们还在苦战呢
but we're getting our asses kicked down here.

1366
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,180
卡魔拉还没把门打开
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

1367
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:38,460
星云
Nebula!

1368
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,300
妹妹  帮我们一起打败罗南吧
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

1369
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:43,960
你很清楚他就是个疯子
You know he's crazy.

1370
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:45,970
你们俩都是疯子
I know you're both crazy.

1371
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:47,500
不
No!

1372
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:50,800
什么鬼...
What the...?

1373
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:53,390
滚出去
Get out!

1374
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:36,890
你成功了
You did it!

1375
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:04,470
之前我错了
I was mistaken.

1376
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,590
我确实记得你家人
I do remember your family.

1377
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:08,460
她们临死时的叫声
Their screams were

1378
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:10,740
那么可悲  我
pitiful. I...

1379
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:08,980
不  格鲁特
No, Groot!

1380
01:39:09,330 --> 01:39:10,750
别这样
You can't.

1381
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:12,270
你会死的
You'll die.

1382
01:39:12,820 --> 01:39:14,660
为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

1383
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:15,930
为什么
Why?

1384
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:24,680
我们
We...

1385
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:26,100
是
are...

1386
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:28,690
格鲁特
Groot.

1387
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,500
真是个白痴
I called him an idiot.

1388
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:59,140
是你杀了格鲁特
You killed Groot!

1389
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:04,630
看吧
Behold!

1390
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:08,830
看这支银河护卫队
Your guardians of the galaxy.

1391
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:11,460
你们护卫了什么
What fruit have they wrought?

1392
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:15,790
现在我终于得偿所愿
Only that my father and his father

1393
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:19,380
为我父亲和爷爷报了仇
shall finally know vengeance.

1394
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:21,780
山达尔的子民
People of Xandar,

1395
01:41:22,220 --> 01:41:25,760
背弃你们卑微的信仰
the time has come to rejoice

1396
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:29,800
迎接我的时刻到了
and renounce your paltry gods!

1397
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:33,940
你们即将得到救赎
Your salvation is at hand.

1398
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,700
听这几句
Listen to these words.

1399
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:58,550
用力舞起来
Now bring it down hard!

1400
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:03,180
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

1401
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:06,270
比舞啊  老兄  就我们俩
Dance-off, Bro. Me and you.

1402
01:42:09,810 --> 01:42:10,560
卡魔拉
Gamora.

1403
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:13,690
委婉拒绝  收回邀请
Subtle. Take it back.

1404
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:16,860
你到底在搞什么鬼
What are you doing?

1405
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:19,550
分你的心啊  大蠢蛋
I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom.

1406
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:37,230
不
No!

1407
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:15,500
彼得  握住我的手
Peter! Take my hand!

1408
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:21,710
握住我的手  彼得
Take my hand, Peter.

1409
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:23,800
妈妈
Mom.

1410
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:27,140
握住我的手
Take my hand!

1411
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:22,440
你们只是凡人
You're mortal!

1412
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:24,400
怎么可能
How?

1413
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,950
你不是说过吗  婊子
You said it yourself, bitch.

1414
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:29,390
我们可是银河护卫队
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1415
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:00,690
不错  不错
Well, well, well.

1416
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,980
好一场光影盛宴
Quite the light show.

1417
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:06,400
大团圆结局啊
Ain't this sweet.

1418
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:09,820
不过在你们嘿咻嘿咻之前
But you got some business to attend to

1419
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,660
先给我把正事办了
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1420
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:16,540
彼得  你不能给他
Peter, you can't. Peter.

1421
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:18,740
你得三思  勇度
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.

1422
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:20,710
我不知道你要把它卖给谁
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1423
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:22,750
不过能让宇宙安定平稳的唯一方法
but the only way the universe can survive

1424
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:25,170
就是把它交给新星军团保管
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1425
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:28,260
都说我长得像菩萨
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1426
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:32,260
可我没有菩萨心肠
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1427
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,180
快交给我吧  孩子
Hand it over, son.

1428
01:45:51,860 --> 01:45:52,860
勇度
Yondu.

1429
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:59,830
决不能打开宇宙灵球  你知道的吧
Do not open that Orb. You know that, right?

1430
01:45:59,860 --> 01:46:02,300
你也看见它的威力了
You've seen what it does to people.

1431
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:15,300
奎尔这小子还挺懂事
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

1432
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:18,430
当初没有按他爹的要求把他送过去
It's probably good we didn't deliver him to his dad

1433
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:19,900
也许是个正确的决定
like we was hired to do.

1434
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:22,750
是啊  他爹就是个混球
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1435
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:29,610
等他发现宇宙灵球被我掉包了
He is gonna be so pissed when he realizes

1436
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:31,230
非气炸不可
I switched out the Orb on him.

1437
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:36,030
他一定会砍死你  彼得
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1438
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:38,660
是啊
Oh, I know.

1439
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:42,960
不过他也算是我唯一的亲人了
But he was about the only family I had.

1440
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:46,100
不
No.

1441
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:48,580
不止是他
He wasn't.

1442
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:38,390
你们怎么连这个都知道
Why would you even know this?

1443
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:39,400
当初抓你回来后
When we arrested you,

1444
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:41,310
我们发现你的神经系统有些异常
we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system,

1445
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:43,020
于是帮你做了检查
so we had it checked out.

1446
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:45,730
所以我不是地星人
I'm not Terran?

1447
01:47:45,820 --> 01:47:47,340
有一半血统来自地星
You are half Terran.

1448
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:51,140
你母亲是地球人  至于你父亲
Your mother was of Earth. Your father, well,

1449
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:54,860
他是某种我们从未接触过的远古生灵
he's something very ancient we've never seen here before.

1450
01:47:55,180 --> 01:47:55,900
怪不得
That could be why

1451
01:47:55,930 --> 01:47:58,740
你握着宝石那么久却没事
you were able to hold the Stone for as long as you did.

1452
01:47:59,870 --> 01:48:01,700
你的朋友们来齐了
Your friends have arrived.

1453
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:04,580
我谨代表新星军团
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1454
01:48:05,290 --> 01:48:08,540
向你们致以最真诚的谢意
we'd like to express our profound gratitude

1455
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:11,380
谢谢你们拯救了山达尔
for your help in saving Xandar.

1456
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:15,010
你们可以跟随丹纳利安·戴
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1457
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:16,660
他有东西要带你们看
he has something to show you.

1458
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:18,130
谢谢了  新星至尊
Thank you, Nova Prime.

1459
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:29,560
你帮妻女报了仇
Your wife and child shall rest well

1460
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:31,900
现在她们能安息了
knowing that you have avenged them.

1461
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:33,340
是啊
Yes.

1462
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:35,420
不过说到底罗南只是个傀儡
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1463
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:38,700
得杀掉灭霸才算报仇
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1464
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:43,780
我们想保留它原本的样子
We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible.

1465
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:46,340
已经尽全力做了相关修复了
We salvaged as much as we could.

1466
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:50,460
我
I...

1467
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:53,580
多谢了
Thank you.

1468
01:48:55,210 --> 01:48:56,710
我也有妻儿
I have a family.

1469
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:59,130
多亏你她们才能活下来
They're alive because of you.

1470
01:49:03,050 --> 01:49:05,850
你们的犯罪记录已经被抹掉了
Your criminal records have also been expunged.

1471
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:07,020
不过还是得提醒你们
However, I have to warn

1472
01:49:07,050 --> 01:49:09,980
遵纪守法才是好公民
you against breaking any laws in the future.

1473
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:11,230
问一下
Question.

1474
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:12,940
如果我拿了一件很想要的
What if I see something that I want to take,

1475
01:49:12,980 --> 01:49:14,350
刚好又属于别人的东西呢
and it belongs to someone else?

1476
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:15,710
你会被逮捕
You will be arrested.

1477
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:17,980
可如果我比物主更想要那东西呢
But what if I want it more than the person who has it?

1478
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:20,280
-还是违法的  -说不通啊
- It's still illegal. - That doesn't follow.

1479
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,160
我更想要啊  长官  你懂吗
No, I want it more, sir. Do you understand?

1480
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:23,120
笑什么
What are you laughing at?

1481
01:49:23,150 --> 01:49:25,110
干嘛拉我走  我不能和这位先生聊聊吗
Why? I can't have a discussion with this gentleman?

1482
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:26,980
如果谁把我惹毛了
What if someone does something irksome

1483
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:29,500
然后我决定要抽了他的脊椎呢
and I decide to remove his spine?

1484
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:31,980
那个
That's...

1485
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:35,880
那个应该算谋杀了
That's actually murder.

1486
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:39,670
最恶劣的犯罪之一
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1487
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:42,660
所以  也是违法的
So... also illegal.

1488
01:49:46,510 --> 01:49:47,890
他们会老实待着的  戴
They'll be fine, Dey.

1489
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:49,310
我会看好他们的
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1490
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:50,340
你
You?

1491
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:56,190
对啊  我
Yeah. Me.

1492

彼得
Peter,

1493
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:21,380
我知道最近几个月对你来说很痛苦
I know these last few months have been hard for you.

1494
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:25,070
其实我只是要去个更好的地方
But I'm going to a better place.

1495
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:27,700
我会照顾好自己的
And I will be okay.

1496
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:31,580
我会永远陪在你身边
And I will always be with you.

1497
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:35,980
你是我生命的曙光
You are the light of my life.

1498
01:50:36,140 --> 01:50:38,380
我挚爱的儿子
My precious son.

我的小星爵
My little Star-Lord.

1500
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:44,980

So, what should we do next?

1503
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:49,240
干点好事
Something good?

干点坏事
Something bad?

还是都干一点
A bit of both?

你说了算  星爵
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.
